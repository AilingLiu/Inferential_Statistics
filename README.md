# Inferential Statistics

This notebook summarizes the testing methods from <b>Inferential Statitistics </b> course taught by University of Amsterdam on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics). The course had used R on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/inferential-statistics) to conduct statistical test. Here, I am using Python to do the test. All the formulas used in this document can be found [here](https://github.com/AilingLiu/Inferential_Statistics/blob/master/FormulasTables.pdf).
